<h1><b>What is this?</b></h1>
Sudoku, but interact-able by your hand. All movements are predicted using MediaPipe, through a video feed.

<h1><b>Why?</b></h1>
As the interface between a human and a machine gets more seamless, the need for "external" devices like get less prominent. Video-feed based movement reading and interpretation could be one of the substitute to mouses and keyboards.(also, we needed to pimp up our project)

<h1><b>How to Run This?</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Step-1: Download the project files and places them in the directory you wish</li>
  <li>Step-2: Run </li><code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code> to install the libraries needed. 
  <li>Step-3: Run the <code>main.py</code> file and you should be able to now play Sudoku</li>
</ul>

<b>Note: </b>The libraries use upto ~100MB of disk space.
  
<h3><b>TODO -</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Draw the Sudoku and Buttons</li>
  <li>Track Hands and Get Mouse Coords upon Click</li>
  <li>Make the Sudoku Solver</li>
  <li>Modularize and integrate all the code</li>
</ul>
